Hi! I'm Jess. \
\
I'm an award-winning audio/video producer and creative project manager. I know how to develop and pitch show ideas, give great editorial feedback and lead big, creative projects with lots of high-stakes clients. \
\
I've spent most of my audio career at Pineapple Street Studios, where I produced nonfiction series and interview shows like *70 over 70*, Amazon/Wondery's *Ghost Story*, ESPN's *Bloodlines* and Nike's first podcast, *Trained.*\
\
Prior to Pineapple, I worked on the HBO show *High Maintenance.* 

Currently I'm the Senior Producer of *What Now? with Trevor Noah*, where I oversee our entire video production process. If you ever need to build a set from scratch in a hotel room in Abu Dhabi and produce an interview with Trevor Noah and Idris Elba and publish the interview in less than 36 hours, hit me up. 

I'm always looking to work with good people on exciting, challenging and meaningful projects.
