I can do a lot of things.

I’m mostly a podcast producer and creative project manager, but if you need someone who can

* produce video shoots 
* work with brands and build their stories
* successfully develop and pitch your show ideas —nonfiction, scripted series, reality shows. I've got you covered.
* conduct interviews 
* report stories 
* write  — scripts, copy, wedding toats, travel guides, episode descriptions, birthday cards, to-do lists
* lead teams of creative people
* manage big creative projects with lots of high-stakes clients
* give unsolicited advice about working in podcasts, television and film
