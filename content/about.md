I can do a lot of things. 

I’m mostly a podcast producer and creative project manager, but if you need someone who can...

* produce video shoots 
* work with brands and build their stories
* successfully develop and pitch your show ideas —nonfiction, scripted series, reality shows
* conduct interviews 
* report stories 
* write  — scripts, copy of all kinds, wedding toasts,  to-do lists
* lead teams of creative people
* manage big creative projects with lots of high-stakes clients
* give unsolicited advice about working in podcasts, television and film

... hit me up.
