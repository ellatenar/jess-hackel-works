I can do a lot of things.

I’m mostly a podcast producer, but if you need someone who can

* produce video shoots 
* work with brands and build their stories
* successfully develop and pitch your show ideas — nonfiction, docs, scripted…whatever! 
* conduct interviews 
* report stories 
*  write  — scripts, copy, travel guides, episode descriptions
* lead teams of creative people
* manage big creative projects with lots of high-stakes clients
* give unsolicited advice about working in podcasts, television and film

hit me up.
